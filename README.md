## Challenges we faced

Creating City Connect presented various challenges, particularly in the implementation of dynamic web scraping using Selenium. This process proved to be time-consuming as we aimed to ensure real-time and accurate updates for our users. Overcoming the intricacies of dynamic content and adapting to the ever-changing web landscape required dedicated effort and problem-solving.

Our commitment to delivering a seamless experience for students motivated us to navigate through the complexities of dynamic web scraping, ensuring the reliability of the data presented on our platform.
